 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript , React , Node.js<br/><br/> 
 The goal was to showcase my improved skills by building a weather application using React. Although simple in design using a new library to build was quite the challenge. Usings hooks to not only fetch data but to also change data displayed. Instead on standard HTML file using JSX helped deliver a unique way to build the UI for the user.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Optimizations:</h1>
  When improving this application I would add a  geolocation function so users can have exact forecast in relation to their position. the bacground picture matches weather forecast for that day. Focus on mobile build with react-native.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Lessons Learned:</h1>
 When using hook to call weather API don't call function until I'm ready API is continously being called. Use JSX to advantage when building UI.
